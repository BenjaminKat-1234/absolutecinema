Replace Sharkbooidk.png with your image and follow the steps in the comments.

Tip:

Before you bring your absolute cinema image into the generator, I recommend you bring it into a black-and-white converter first (I used https://blackandwhite.imageonline.co/, this link is NOT owned by me and was the first thing you get when you search up black and white converter on Google)
